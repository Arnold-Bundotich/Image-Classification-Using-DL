# Image-Classification-Using-DL
Step 1
Importing major libraries 
- Matplotlip.pyplot
- Numpy
Improting Gabor Filter
Step 2
Loading the image in Python
resizing the image
Step 3
Feature Extraction
after looking the feature extraction is the same every where 
Step 4
Define Gabor filters we want to use
Step 5
Assign Class for each image classification
Step 6
Combine datasets
Step 7
Randomly splits the data and respective labels (y values) into a train and test set, the size of the
test set is specified to be 20%
Step 8
Check the sizes of our training and test sets
Step 9
Import datasets, classifiers and performance metrics
Step 10
Define the model 
using the rbf it gives us the higher test and train accuracy then we owe it for the training
Step 11
After checking the model we build a Convolution Neural Network
